# HappyHorse by Ace Data Cloud for LlamaIndex

[简体中文](readme/README_zh_Hans.md) · [Current model access and prices](https://platform.acedata.cloud/models?utm_source=llamaindex&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=evergreen&utm_content=happyhorse_llamaindex_pricing)

Independently maintained by **Ace Data Cloud**, not an official HappyHorse or LlamaIndex product.
The native `BaseToolSpec` package exposes three sync/async `FunctionTool`s accepted
by `FunctionAgent`, without an MCP address or hand-written HTTP wrapper:

- `happyhorse_generate_video`: submit text-to-video once.
- `happyhorse_generate_video_from_image`: first-frame image-to-video once.
- `happyhorse_get_task`: query an existing task ID, including after a process restart.

## 1. Install the correct native package

Python 3.10+. Standard package **`llama-index-tools-happyhorse-acedatacloud`**, import `happyhorse_acedatacloud`.
**Publication status: source review; not yet published to PyPI or approved in an official directory.**
Use the source PR/commit or its CI wheel until a real release is available:

```bash
pip install "llama-index-tools-happyhorse-acedatacloud @ git+https://github.com/AceDataCloud/HappyHorseLlamaIndex.git@codex/native-happyhorse-tools"
```

This package reuses the released Ace SDK, with fixed API base and retries disabled.
It does not modify the shared SDK/MCP repositories. [Official ToolSpec pattern](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/deploying/agents/tools/).

## 2. Register/sign in and get the application API Token

1. [Register or sign in to Ace Data Cloud](https://platform.acedata.cloud?utm_source=llamaindex&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=evergreen&utm_content=happyhorse_llamaindex_register).
2. Open [Applications](https://platform.acedata.cloud/console/applications?utm_source=llamaindex&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=evergreen&utm_content=happyhorse_llamaindex_api_key). Find **General application**;
   if absent, click **Initialize General Application**. Its key uses only the services
   permitted for your account; a dedicated application's key is service-limited.
3. Copy an API Key, or choose **Manage Keys → Create** for a separate `LlamaIndex HappyHorse` key.
   Check model availability, service access, balance and [current pricing](https://platform.acedata.cloud/models?utm_source=llamaindex&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=evergreen&utm_content=happyhorse_llamaindex_balance) before generating.

4. Review **Expiration Time**, **Set Usage Limitation**, **Allowed APIs**.
   If restricting APIs, allow `/happyhorse/videos` and **`/happyhorse/tasks`**.
   Create, return to the key list and copy only the raw token; do not include `Bearer `,
   spaces, quotes or redacted screenshot characters. `platform-...` management tokens do not work here.

These real redacted images are reused from SunoDify's linked fixed commit,
retrieved 2026-10-18. The old example name `Dify tutorial` is historical;
use `LlamaIndex HappyHorse`. These show generic Ace account setup, not this tool running.

## 3. Paste the key in the native configuration

Set **`ACEDATACLOUD_API_TOKEN`** in the application environment, or pass `api_token`
from a secret store. No key is included in the agent-visible tool schema.

```python
from llama_index.tools.happyhorse_acedatacloud import HappyHorseToolSpec

spec = HappyHorseToolSpec()
tools = spec.to_tool_list()
print([tool.metadata.name for tool in tools])
# With your existing supported LlamaIndex LLM:
# agent = FunctionAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools)
```

Constructing tools and inspecting schemas sends no generation. LlamaIndex is a
code framework: no new settings page, provider dropdown or media GUI is promised.
Do not put credentials in prompts, logs, exported notebooks or Git.

## 4. First use and same-task recovery

The next snippet creates a **billable** task. Replace the model placeholder with a
model currently available to your account and approve the cost before running it.
There is no default or fallback model. Output/cost parameters are explicit.

```python
import asyncio
from llama_index.tools.happyhorse_acedatacloud import HappyHorseToolSpec


async def main():
    spec = HappyHorseToolSpec()
    try:
        tools = spec.to_tool_list()
        submission = (
            await tools[0].acall(
                prompt="A quiet sunrise garden, gentle camera movement.",
                model="YOUR_AVAILABLE_MODEL",
                duration=5,
                resolution="720P",
            )
        ).raw_output
        task_id = submission["task_id"]  # save outside this process
        await asyncio.sleep(15)
        result = (await tools[2].acall(task_id=task_id)).raw_output
        print(result)
    finally:
        await spec.aclose()


asyncio.run(main())
```

One submit and one query only. A pending result is normal. Query **only the same
ID** after at least 15 seconds; never rerun the whole generation to check progress.
After restarting your application, load a new `HappyHorseToolSpec` with the same authorized
application key and call the query tool. No local generation state is required:

```bash
python examples/query_existing.py YOUR_EXISTING_TASK_ID
```

Final output requires `status=succeeded`, `success=true` and non-empty `media_urls`.
Pending/processing preview links are hidden. Failed task states stay failed;
unknown IDs return `not_found`, not an invitation to resubmit. A returned task ID
that differs from the requested one is rejected. 401/403/429/500 keep SDK error meaning,
and there are zero automatic retries. For ambiguous timeouts/missing task IDs,
inspect account history before considering another paid submission.

## Service contract and supported scope

Text generation accepts happyhorse-1.0-t2v or happyhorse-1.1-t2v; image animation accepts matching i2v models. No model is automatically changed to match an action. Duration is 3–15 seconds; resolution is 720P/1080P. Reference-to-video and video editing are not exposed in this focused package.

Image inputs are public HTTP(S) URLs without embedded credentials. Local files
and inline data URIs are intentionally outside this adapter's input surface.
[Current contracts and pinned sources](docs/contracts.json).
Other endpoints/advanced actions are not implied by the presence of these tools.

## 5. Verify without paid API calls

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python examples/offline.py
pytest
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
python -m build
```

The offline example calls real native tools/SDK with mocked HTTP and synthetic
IDs/media URLs. CI installs a built wheel outside the source tree and verifies
submit → recover with a new tool instance → same-ID query. This is not a real
media/billing receipt. The package does not synthesize a final text answer.

| Symptom | What to do |
|---|---|
| Package absent on PyPI | Initial publication is pending; install the PR/CI wheel for review. |
| Missing key / 401 | Recopy raw application token; check expiry, API restrictions and service access. |
| 403 or balance error | Check the exact service/model entitlement and budget, not repeated generation. |
| 429 / network timeout | No retries; inspect whether the task was accepted before another submission. |
| Pending / preview URLs | Wait, query the same ID. Only final media_urls are deliverable output. |
| not_found / denied query | Verify task ID and owning application access. Knowing an ID does not grant permission. |
| Unsupported action/model options | Choose explicit parameters for this tool's documented action; no model substitution. |

## Release and official discovery

Prepared PyPI Trusted Publisher: existing authorized PyPI owner configures project
`llama-index-tools-happyhorse-acedatacloud`, owner `AceDataCloud`, repo `HappyHorseLlamaIndex`, workflow `publish.yml`, environment `pypi`.
Human review/merge/release authorization is still required. No new identities or
terms acceptance are performed. After publishing, verify public wheel bytes and a
clean pip install. Source PR, package release, official listing and real task/bill
are separate stages. Official documentation discovery is coordinated via
https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/pull/23574 ; draft is not approved inclusion.

MIT. HappyHorse names identify the supported service; Ace Data Cloud maintains this integration.
